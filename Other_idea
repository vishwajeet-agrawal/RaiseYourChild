Comments(By Lakshay): I feel idea of TrueReward is very straightforward and easily distinguishes between good and bad(sort of boring), rather we should leave some ambiguity of decisons to users themselves.


Idea 1:(I like this more)

	Can have  puzzle type game, where we are a country's decision maker, and there are 4 parameters of our country:

	1. Noise Pollution
	2. Air Pollution
	3. Land Pollution
	4. Water Pollution
	5. Money available

	The pollution parameters will always keep increasing, with more money we can buy equipments that reduce their increase rate.

	Different events related to our country are taking place(Dont need a lot of events, same event can occur after some time again)
	Events like:
	1. A world leader coming to our country(Will increase noise pollution but can decrease Air pollution since that country can give us better technology for air purifierws))
	(A choice whether to invit that leader or not)
	2. A tsunami in the nearby Ocean(Tsunami increases water pollution: Choice: To treat the water polluted, will decrease the money but wont affect water pollution)

	When one of the pollution crosses a barrier value, game ends. 
	Aim to last as much time as possible.
	(Can make it multiplayer also as 2 countries have can help each other so they last longer)

Idea 2:(More difficult to implement, hence, not preferred)

	Game on parental pressure on Children.
	Our player is a parent raising his/her child.
	Like above game, here also parameters like 
	1. Kid's intelligence
	2. Respect towards parent
	3. Kid's sense of responsibility
	4. Kid's mental health

	Events like:
	1. Kid wants to go to play at 8 PM(Choice: Let him go- Decreases his sense of responsibility OR Stop him: Increases his sense of responsibility but decreases respect toward parent)
	2. Gets low grade(Choice: Shout and punish him OR Console him and help him)
	
	Aim: To make every parameter cross a certain barrier
