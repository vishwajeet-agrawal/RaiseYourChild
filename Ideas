Philosophy:
Based of philosophy of Law of Karma frequently referred in the Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhist sacred texts and discourses. This game tries to quantify the karmic accounts and consequences that we must face based on how we think, behave and act in different situations of life.

Social relevance:
The philosophy of karma has been instrumental for ages in the Indian subcontinent in sustaining self disciplined law and order in the society.
It is also responsible for incentivising to take a moral choice rather than a purely selfish or that inflicts pain and harm to others. Even in the most selfish regime, the philosophy of karma dictates one to act morally and take actions that are in the interest of all to maximize one's own happiness and well-being. Some stronger statements in the philosophy like "Not acting where one can act to serve is also bad" further encourages and motivates one to take initiatives in public situations out of one's own interests and comfort.

Other points to consider:
1. Add a disclaimer on the start, backing the philosophy and stating scientific agnosticism (clearing that there is no grounded scientific 
antagonism for the philosophy). Further clearing that the quantification is purely the choice of the developers and is purely fitcitious although 
is open to discourse and further improvements are underway, Feedback is highly welcome.
